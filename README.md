# change-desktop
This utility should work with most picture formats (I've tested with JPG and PNG files). It will set the Picture mode to "Fill".

To run, be sure to add the location of `change-desktop.bat` to the windows PATH, or specify the entire path name when running it.

```
change-desktop picture.jpg
```

or

```
%PATH_TO_FILE%/change-desktop picture.jpg
```
